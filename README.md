# PEARL
Pearl is an Interactive Visual Analytic Tool for Understanding Personal Emotion Style Derived from Social Media

In the rapidly blooming world of social media, the emotions of a user play a vital role in deciding his/her/their future actions. The visualization will display a person's emotional profiles on a timeline-based visualization graph derived from tweets.

There are 3 major steps to generate this visualization. Firstly, we will be doing a multi-dimensional emotional analysis of social media text to infer the mood from a summarized set of emotions. In the second step, we transform the multidimensional emotion analysis into a timeline-based visual profile. In the third step, we try to eliminate the noise by providing details of emotional states and their triggers.
